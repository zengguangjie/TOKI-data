# **TopDom**
**TopDom** is a software tool to ideintify Topological Domains, which are basic builiding blocks of genome structrue. TopDom is computationally very efficient. Using detecting optimal polygon algorithm, TopDom detect topological domains in a linear time. As well as, this tool requires only a single parameter, which enable user to use easily. 

Reslease Note v0.0.2
- Gap Identification module is changed.
- Minor bug related to Change Points identificaiton in very small regions is fixed.
- bed format support
